# dotfiles
These are my dotfiles. Well, more like dotfile.

# link.sh
A small script that links all dotfiles in the correct places.
Needs to be run from this folder(as in the cloned repository folder).
echo "The script you are running has basename `basename $0`, dirname `dirname $0`"
echo "The present working directory is `pwd`"
