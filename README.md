# dotfiles
These are my dotfiles. Well, more like dotfile.

# link.sh
A small script that links all dotfiles in the correct places.
Needs to be run from this folder(as in the cloned repository folder).

# init.el
[What is emacs?](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)

Before switching to spacemacs this was my emacs config.

# .spacemacs
[What is spacemacs?](http://spacemacs.org/)

Settings:
* shell default pos: bottom
* shell default height: 30
* remove trailing whitespace on save
* Relative line numbers
* Maximize on startup
* finer undo (do not undo one whole insert)
* When in spacemacs buffer, clicking on latest file does not yank whatever into the newly opened buffer. (What a feature...)

Layers added:
* ivy
* auto-completion
* emacs-lisp
* git
* markdown
* syntax-checking
* version-control
* c-c++
